    <h1>Privacy Statement DRAFT</h1>
    <p>
    This Statement is effective as of November 2016. The previous version of this Statement is available here.
Your privacy is important to Strictly Clubs; maintaining your trust is paramount to us.
This Statement discloses the information practices for Strictly Clubs’s and our affiliates’ Web sites, from what type of information about our Web sites’ users is gathered and tracked, to how the information is used, shared or otherwise processed offline. It also describes how cookies, web beacons and other technologies may be used in our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings and software products.
This Statement applies to Strictly Clubs Web sites that link to this Statement but does not apply to those Strictly Clubs Web sites that have their own Privacy Statement. Additionally, it does not apply to instances where we merely process data on behalf of clients for their benefit, such as when we act as a web hosting service provider.
From time to time, we may supplement this Statement with additional information relating to a particular interaction we have with you.
Strictly Clubs has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal for the practices described in this Privacy Statement as it pertains to our Strictly Clubs.com websites. This means that our practices as it relates to these websites have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's Certification Standards, including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. The seal covers only information that is collected through www.Strictly Clubs.com and does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software, SaaS offerings, or mobile applications. These practices also comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System as assessed by TRUSTe. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact the Strictly Clubs Web site coordinator. If you are not satisfied with our response, you can contact TRUSTe. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison to help resolve your concerns.
